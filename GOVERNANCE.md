# HolySheet Governance üôè

This document outlines how HolySheet is managed and developed as a small but professional open-source project.

## Project Philosophy

**"Professional but not overwhelming"** - We maintain high standards without bureaucratic overhead.

### Core Principles
- **Quality over quantity** - Every feature should add real value
- **User-first** - Decisions prioritize user experience and needs  
- **Transparency** - Open development process and clear communication
- **Simplicity** - Keep architecture and processes as simple as possible
- **Security** - Privacy and security are non-negotiable

## Project Structure

### Maintainership
- **Primary Maintainer**: [@seheart](https://github.com/seheart)
- **Open to co-maintainers** as the project grows
- **Community contributors** welcome for all aspects

### Repository Organization
```
holysheet/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/          # GitHub workflows, templates, policies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/            # Test suite (growing as needed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wiki/             # Documentation source
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py            # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Production dependencies  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements-dev.txt # Development dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml    # Project configuration
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, always deployable
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for new features (when needed)
- **Feature branches** - `feature/description` for new functionality
- **Hotfix branches** - `hotfix/description` for urgent fixes

### Pull Request Process
1. **Fork & branch** from `main` (or `develop` for features)
2. **Develop & test** your changes locally
3. **Submit PR** using the provided template
4. **Code review** by maintainers
5. **CI checks** must pass (formatting, tests, security)
6. **Merge** after approval

### Code Standards
- **Python 3.8+** compatibility required
- **Black** for code formatting (88 character line length)
- **flake8** for linting
- **Type hints** encouraged but not required
- **Docstrings** for public functions and classes

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- **CI/CD Pipeline** runs on all PRs and main branch
- **Code formatting** with Black
- **Linting** with flake8 
- **Security scanning** with Snyk and Safety
- **Dependency updates** via Dependabot

### Testing Strategy
- **Import tests** - Ensure code can be imported
- **Unit tests** - Core functionality testing
- **Integration tests** - API integration testing (when feasible)
- **Manual testing** - UI and user experience validation

### Release Process
1. **Version bump** following semantic versioning
2. **Update changelog** with new features and fixes
3. **Tag release** on GitHub
4. **Release notes** with upgrade instructions
5. **Security review** for each release

## Issue Management

### Issue Triage
- **Labels** for categorization (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
- **Priority levels** (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Assignment** to maintainers or contributors
- **Milestones** for release planning

### Response Times (Goals)
- **Critical bugs**: 24 hours
- **Regular bugs**: 1 week  
- **Feature requests**: 2 weeks
- **Questions**: 48 hours

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Triage** - Label, prioritize, assign
2. **Investigation** - Reproduce, understand scope
3. **Development** - Implement fix or feature
4. **Review** - Code review and testing
5. **Release** - Include in next version
6. **Verification** - Confirm resolution

## Security & Privacy

### Security First
- **Vulnerability disclosure** process in SECURITY.md
- **Regular dependency updates** 
- **Code scanning** in CI pipeline
- **Privacy by design** principles

### Data Handling
- **Local processing** where possible
- **Minimal data retention** 
- **Transparent** about external API usage
- **User control** over data sharing

## Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct
- **Be respectful** and inclusive
- **Constructive feedback** only
- **No harassment** or discrimination
- **Focus on the work** not the person

### Communication Channels
- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** - Questions and general discussion
- **Pull Requests** - Code review and technical discussion
- **Email** - Security issues and private matters

## Decision Making

### Feature Decisions
1. **Community input** via issues and discussions
2. **Maintainer evaluation** of feasibility and fit
3. **Implementation planning** and resource allocation
4. **Transparent communication** of decisions

### Breaking Changes
- **Avoid when possible** - Maintain backward compatibility
- **Clear migration path** when necessary
- **Advance notice** in release notes
- **Documentation** of changes

## Project Roadmap

### Short Term (Next Release)
- **Bug fixes** and stability improvements
- **Documentation** enhancements
- **Basic test coverage** expansion

### Medium Term (Next Quarter)
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Additional data source support**
