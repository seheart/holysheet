## üéØ Cost Management Strategies

### Optimize Your Queries

#### ‚úÖ Cost-Effective Approaches
```
‚ùå "Tell me everything about this data" ($0.50-1.00)
‚úÖ "What are the top 3 spending categories?" ($0.10-0.20)

‚ùå Multiple separate questions
‚úÖ "Analyze spending patterns, identify trends, and suggest 3 optimizations" ($0.20-0.40)
```

#### Batch Your Questions
```
Single efficient request:
"Please analyze this financial data and provide:
1. Monthly spending trends
2. Category breakdowns  
3. Budget recommendations
4. Potential data quality issues"

Cost: $0.30-0.60 vs $1.20-2.40 for separate requests
```

### Smart Data Management

#### Use Appropriate Ranges
```
‚ùå Entire sheet (A:Z) - includes empty columns
‚úÖ Specific range (A1:J1000) - only needed data

‚ùå Historical data when analyzing current month  
‚úÖ Relevant time period (last 6 months for trends)
```

#### Preprocessing Tips
- Remove empty rows/columns before analysis
- Use meaningful column headers
- Focus on relevant date ranges
- Consider data sampling for very large sheets

### Session Optimization

#### Efficient Workflows
1. **Start broad**: "Overview of this financial data"
2. **Drill down**: "Explain the unusual spike in March"
3. **Get specific**: "Create formulas to track this metric"

#### Avoid These Cost Traps
- Repeatedly asking similar questions
- Loading same data multiple times
- Analyzing entire historical datasets when recent data suffices
- Asking for clarification instead of being specific initially
